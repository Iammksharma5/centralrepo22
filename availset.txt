An availability set is a logical grouping of VMs within a datacenter that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide for redundancy and availability.

No cost for availability set itself,you only pay for each VM instance that you create.

Two additional groupings


> Fault Domains:

* Logical Group of underlying hardware that share a common power
  source and network switch , similar to a rack within an on-premises datacenter.

* VMs get automatically distributed as you create them within a Fault Domain in an availability set, up to D3 FD



> Update Domains

* Logical group of underlying hardware that can undergo maintenance or he  rebooted at the same time.

* The order of reboot may not proceed sequenatially during planned maintenance,but only one update domain is rebooted at a time.

* Vms are automatically distributed across Update Domains in an Availability Set, up to 20 & by default 05 Update Domains
